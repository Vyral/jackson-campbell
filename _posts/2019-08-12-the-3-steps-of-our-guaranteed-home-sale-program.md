Many people are at a loss when deciding whether they should buy their next home first or sell their current home first. Our guaranteed sale program is designed to help you decide which option is best for you. There are three steps involved in the program. First, we do a thorough market analysis to determine the value of your home. Next, we come up with a sale price, which we guarantee. Finally, we market the home for sale, and if we attain a higher sale price than what was agreed, you keep the difference. If you feel like this program will take the stress out of your transaction, donâ€™t hesitate to give me a call so we can talk more about how it can benefit you. I look forward to hearing from you.
