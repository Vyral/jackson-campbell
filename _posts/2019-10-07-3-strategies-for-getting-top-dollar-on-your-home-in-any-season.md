&nbsp;

Profitable deals are possible at any point in the year for home sellers in our market, but it takes careful planning to achieve these kinds of results.&nbsp;

Here are three key strategies you can use to get top dollar for your home, no matter the season:

**1\. Sell a lifestyle.** Every property has unique features and assets, so play yours up. If your home has a great back yard, perfect for entertaining under the stars, make that a selling point and do your best to target “outdoorsy” buyers. If your home has a huge kitchen, make that a key feature of your marketing. It’s all about identifying the kind of lifestyle your home facilitates, then reaching out to buyers who would be interested in that way of living.&nbsp;

<br>**2\. Stage your home.** Telling buyers what kind of life they could lead in your property will only go so far. You also need to show them by decluttering, depersonalizing, and staging your listing. Buyers want to be able to see your house as their future home.&nbsp;

<br>**3\. Avoid overpricing your home.** Everyone wants to earn top dollar, but setting your price too high can have the opposite effect. The secret to getting a great deal is actually to set your price at (or slightly below) market value, which will attract a higher number of buyers and could potentially incite a bidding war. Think of it this way: If your home is listed alongside four very similar properties, but yours is the only one priced below market value, which do you think buyers are going to gravitate towards? That’s right: Yours. And once you’ve hooked them, they won’t care so much about having to pay a few thousand dollars extra to win out over the other buyers you’ve also drawn in. It’s all about strategy.&nbsp;
