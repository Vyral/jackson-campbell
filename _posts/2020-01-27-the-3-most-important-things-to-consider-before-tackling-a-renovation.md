<center>Undertaking a renovation project is a big step, no matter if it&rsquo;s for one room or a whole home. Here&rsquo;s my advice if you&rsquo;re in a similar situation.</center>

&nbsp;

If you’re thinking about buying a home that needs some work, or making a renovation to your current home, here are three things that you need to consider:

**1\. Know your ability.** We aren’t all interior design specialists. If you don’t know how to pick a tile or what backsplash looks good in a kitchen, get some help. We work with designers who can advise you, and it’s not nearly as expensive as you might think.

**2\. Be realistic about your project.** As you tackle one project, it may make the rest of the home look like an eyesore. Be realistic about the scope of your project, and don’t go too narrow or too wide.

**3\. Manage your finances.** A lot of people don’t realize that there are a lot of different levels to finding materials for renovations. Some materials are available to the public at places like Home Depot and Lowe’s, but there are other professional-grade materials that the average consumer may not have access to. If you do decide to do a renovation, at least reach out to a design consultant. They might have access to materials that will make your home look better and your life easier.

If you have any questions for me, feel free to reach out via phone or email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
