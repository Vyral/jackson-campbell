"It’s no secret that homes that are presented at their best sell for the highest price and in the least amount of time, and my team and I want to make sure your home achieves these same results. This is why we've created the "Renovate to Sell" program."&nbsp;

With this program, not only do we give you an advance on the funds to renovate your property, but we oversee the contractors’ work to ensure everything is done correctly. And the best part? The money won’t be due until you close escrow, so whether it takes 30 days or 30 months, we’ll work with you to see your home sale through.&nbsp;

It works in three simple steps:&nbsp;

**1\. After scheduling a consultation, we’ll sit down with you and compare the benefits of selling your home as is versus using our Renovate to Sell program.&nbsp;**

**2\. We’ll arrange a meeting between you and a designer who will advise you on what &nbsp;items you should focus your renovation efforts on and provide an itemized breakdown of the associated costs.&nbsp;**

**3\. We’ll place your newly renovated home on the market and sell it for top dollar\!&nbsp;**

<br>If you think you could benefit from having a little extra capital and the assistance to renovate your home to its full potential before it goes on the market, please give us a call. We’d be happy to see if this program is a fit for you\!&nbsp;
